Hi, I’m **Tony**

My birth name is **Nguyễn Long Quân**. 

I was born and raised in [Cần Thơ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%E1%BA%A7n_Th%C6%A1), a city to the South of [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam). I moved to Canada at 17, when I adapted the name Tony for the ease of communication. I completed my Computer Science degree in USask and had been working in Saskatoon as a Simulation Modeler ever since.

My interest varies in many areas, like the questions of identity and one's purpose. They eventually lead me to find my faith in **Jesus Christ**, accepting him as my **Lord and Saviour**. I enjoy shooting hoops, studying maths, thinking about dynamic systems and tinkering with computer software and hardware.

This blog is where I document my struggle and learning, for my own future reference. I started this blog because of the need to exercise my brain, as writing is crystallized thinking. Apparently, I have not used my brain that much since the rise of LLMs and Chat Bots.

I hope my future self and you kind readers will find one of the blogs useful, or happiness in criticizing my bad writing.
