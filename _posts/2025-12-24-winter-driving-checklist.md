## Foreword
This is my safety to-do check list to make long winter driving in Canada less intimidating, so that I don't die, and therefore do more traveling. 

This interactive list is arranged in a time line manner, i.e when to what. The checked boxes will reset if the page is refresh.

## A Day before travel
- [ ] Vehicle Works:
  - [ ] Check engine oil level (5W-20)
  - [ ] Check coolant/antifreeze fluid level
  - [ ] Check break fluid level (dot 4)
  - [ ] Check windshield fluid level
  - [ ] Check tires pressure (32 psi)
  - [ ] Check spare tire pressure (60 psi)
  - [ ] Check wheel lug nuts tightness (80 ft-lbs)
  - [ ] Fill up gas (87)
  - [ ] Plug in car oil pan heater and battery charger
  - [ ] Remove build up snow blocks in the fencers

- [ ] Emergency Items:
  - [ ] Headlamps
  - [ ] Tires patch kit
  - [ ] Portable tire pumps (full charge)
  - [ ] Car battery jump cables
  - [ ] Extra winter gloves
  - [ ] Extra dry socks
  - [ ] Blanket
  - [ ] Scented candle and matches

- [ ] Navigation:
  - [ ] Update Google and Apple offline maps
  - [ ] Pick route (has most gas stations/towns) and break stops (max 2 hours apart)
  - [ ] Check weather forecast

- [ ] Consumables:
  - [ ] 2x Monster Zero Ultra
  - [ ] Hot water

## Right before travel
- [ ] Re-Evaluate Traveling:
  - [ ] Check weather updates
  - [ ] Check route condition (Sask Highway Hotline App)

- [ ] Final Vehicle Inspection:
  - [ ] Clear windshield and wipers
  - [ ] Clear headlights
  - [ ] Clear mirrors and front windows
  - [ ] Clear back window, rear wiper and backup cam
  - [ ] Clear rear lights

- [ ] Mental Support
  - [ ] Ask the Lord for protection
  - [ ] Share location to a trusty fam/friend

## During travel
- (Optional) Abide speed limits
- (Optional) Don't die
- Only stop to help a stranger after checking the surroundings. Avoid stopping if in a middle of nowhere; and if a woman is waving for help, just keep on going. It is too sus and has high chance of getting jumped.
- Before attempt something reckless, think of cơm tấm sườn bì chả trứng with de extra cơm.
