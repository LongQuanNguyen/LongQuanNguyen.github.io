## Introduction
Eternal security, often referred to as “once saved, always saved,” is the belief that a true follower of Christ can have full assurance of salvation.

In this post, I will discuss what eternal security is, how a person can have it, and how one can know with certainty that it is theirs.

## What does it mean to be Eternal?
Eternal means lasting forever - unchanging and constant. Eternal is a characteristics of God, and only God could grant blessings that are truly eternal. "For I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed."(Malachi 3:6-18)

God is faithful, meaning He consistently keeps His promises and does not change His mind. As the psalmist asks, “O Lord God of hosts, who is a strong Lord like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee?” (Psalm 89:8).

He cannot lie: “God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?” (Numbers 23:19).

Eternal life implies eternal security and and eternal security implies eternal life. It makes no sense for some one to have one but the other; otherwise, it would not be 'eternal' in the first place.

$\rightarrow$ Because God is faithful and keeps His promises, we can trust that eternal life and eternal security go hand in hand.

## What is the nature of Eternal Security?
Like Salvation, Eternal Security is a gift - given by God's grace and love through our Lord Jesus Christ. "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." (Romans 6:23)

The “eternal” in eternal security is real because it rests on the absolute authority of the One who grants it. “My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father’s hand. I and my Father are one” (John 10:29–30). Moreover, He promised to keep those who come to Him: “All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out” (John 6:37).

## How can we have Eternal Security?
A gift cannot be earned, and eternal security is no exception. We do not work our way into it, nor do we maintain it by our own efforts. "Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;"(Titus 3:5). Our bests simply are not good enough. "But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away."(Isaiah 64:6)

Rather, we can only receive it by faith, confessing in the name of the Lord. "That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."(Romans 10:9-10)

## How can we have assurance of Eternal Security?
The gift of salvation—and eternal security—is the greatest gift of all. We can never lose it, because the Giver Himself is keeping it for us. "Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time."(1 Peter 1:5)
He takes extra care to seal this gift within us. " In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory." (Ephesians 1:13-14)

This means that when we trust in Christ, our salvation is secured by God’s power. The Holy Spirit Himself guarantees our inheritance, giving us confidence that what God has promised will never fail.
